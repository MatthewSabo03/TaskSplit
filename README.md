# TaskSplit
Graduate Applied Project for the Computer Science Department at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology


This project is an Android application built with Kotlin and React Native that intends to help people that struggle with Executive Dysfunctioning 
to more easily complete tasks by allowing them to input tasks into a task list that will automatically break down the task into different subtasks.
This will help the people that struggle with Executive Dysfunctioning to not become overwhelmed with a task. 

The user will also be able to build habits by setting a task as recurring.
